 
#Half The Group
I have chosen to make a website for the improvisation theatre group Half The Group. They offer shows and company events.  
They have a website already but I wanted to improve it in order to reach out to more people what they offer and make it more appealing for people to watch them perform. 
I designed the website to make information about the group members and their shows easy accessible, in order to make it possible for people to follow them and companies to hire them. 
I wanted it to make it easy to make contact so therefor I made a contact form to enable people to reach out with questions and for companies to show their interests.
Here you can view their existing website: https://www.halfthegroup.com/

#UX
I created this website with a wish to make it responsive and to be easy to navigate on all mobile devices.
The colours I choose are pink, grey, white and black since I feel they work well with the existing pictures of the theatre group. 
 
###Target audience:
- Family and friends
- The members of the group
- Companies interested in impro events
- Supporters of the theatre group that wants to buy tickets to their show.
- Audience of the theatre shows

As a supporter and interested in the theatre group I want to be able to see upcoming events so I can come and watch them.
As a supporter I want to see pictures and information about the cast in order get to know them more.
As a company I want information and a contact form so I can hire them on conferences and other events and make my staff happy.
As someone who wants to come and see a show on the theatre for the first time, I want to see the map in order to plan my trip to the theatre.
As someone who has questions about the theatre, wants to join the cast or has other question I want to be able to reach the group easy through the contact form.
As a user of the this website, I want it to be easy to navigate and the pages to be visually appealing so it catches my interest so I will hire them for a company event or visit a show.

#Technologies Used

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)- I used Bootstrap for every page and to make it responsive. For example the carousel image, the hero container and the columns. 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - provided font-family, such as Roboto.
 
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - was used to design my website. 
 
[Coolors](https://coolors.co/806157-cccccc-cf5d9a-e5b6a9-c0287a) - I used this tool to get the colors i wanted to use on my page.

#Testing
CSS code was tested here: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator

HTML-code was tested here: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fkristina-liv.github.io%2FHalf-the-group%2F
I wrote in the address in the form and made changes after that. 

#Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

##Issues found in testing
The text in the hero image on the Ticket-page overflowed so I did some adjustments in padding and made the image size bigger and then it looked better. 
The logo was too big on mobile devices so i deleted letter-spacing in the CSS-file and did adjustments with padding to the right which resolved the problem.
