 
# Half The Group
I have chosen to make a website for the improvisation theatre group Half The Group. They offer shows and company events.  
They have a website already but I wanted to improve it in order to reach out to more people what they offer and make it more appealing for people to watch them perform. 
I designed the website to make information about the group members and their shows easy accessible, in order to make it possible for people to follow them and companies to hire them. 
I wanted to make it to be easy to make contact so therefor I made a contact form to enable people to reach out with questions and for companies to show their interests.
Here you can view their existing website: https://www.halfthegroup.com/

# UX
I created this website with a wish to make it responsive and to be easy to navigate on all mobile devices.
The colours I choose are pink, grey, white and black since I feel they work well with the existing pictures of the theatre group. 
 
### Target audience:
- Family and friends
- The members of the group
- Companies interested in impro events
- Supporters of the theatre group that wants to buy tickets to their show.
- Audience of the theatre shows


As a supporter and interested in the theatre group I want to be able to see upcoming events so I can come and watch them.
As a supporter I want to see pictures and information about the cast in order get to know them more.
As a company I want information and a contact form so I can hire them on conferences and other events and make my staff happy.
As someone who wants to come and see a show on the theatre for the first time, I want to see the map in order to plan my trip to the theatre.
As someone who has questions about the theatre, wants to join the cast or has other question I want to be able to reach the group easy through the contact form.
As a user of the this website, I want it to be easy to navigate and the pages to be visually appealing.

# Technologies Used
 
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)- I used HTML to give structure and content to the page. 
 
[CSS](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - I used CSS to style my website. 
 
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)- I used Bootstrap for every page and to make it responsive. For example the carousel image, the hero container and the columns. 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - provided font-family, such as Roboto.
 
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - was used to design my website. 
 
[Coolors](https://coolors.co/806157-cccccc-cf5d9a-e5b6a9-c0287a) - I used this tool to get the colors i wanted to use on my page. 
 
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)- provided symbols to the main page. 

[Embed Google Map](https://www.embedgooglemap.net/) - to provide a map to the About page. 

# Testing
People can now get easy access to upcoming shows and companies can hire them. 
There is a contact form to create contact. Supporters can get to know the cast a little bit more by seeing the images and the personal quotes. 
People who have questions about the theatre can read information in the "About-page" or send a message. There is also a map for visitors to the coming shows so they can plan their trip there. 
Fans can follow them on social media. 

Throughout the creating and building the website I tested the code in gitpod using “python3 -m http.server” to see how the page looked on the browser. 
A lot of testing was done by the developer tool in Google Chrome, in order to see how responsive the website was in different devices.
As I went along with the project i modified the code especially in the end to make sure it was working well on every device. 


To ensure that all users can successfully use the site, I have been tested it on many browers such as:

- Chrome
- Internet Explorer
- Edge
- Safari
- Firefox
- Opera

I have also tested the page on different devices such as Ipad, Galaxy, Iphone. 


CSS code was tested here: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator

HTML-code was tested here: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fkristina-liv.github.io%2FHalf-the-group%2F
I wrote in the address in the form and made changes after that. 

I have been testing all the links in the navigation menu which all worked fine. The buttons also works well.
The social links will be opened in a new window. I have been using "target="_blank" to manage that. 
All links are pointing to the correct destination.

I have been testing the map, zooming in and out which are working well. 

### Contact form:
I have tested to try to submit the form without a valid email address and I got an error message, noting the invalid email address. 
The "required" attribute have been added to the Email address and the message form fields. If these fields are not filled in the user can not submit the message. 
If all fields are filled in the page will reload. 

## Issues found in testing
- The text in the hero image on the Ticket-page overflowed so I did some adjustments in padding and made the image size bigger and then it looked better. Later on I also decided to move some of the text below the image"
- The logo was too big on mobile devices so I deleted letter-spacing in the CSS-file and did adjustments with size and padding to the right which resolved the problem.
