 
#Half The Group
I have chosen to make a website for the improvisation theatre group Half The Group. They offer shows and company events and guarantee recognition and many laughs!
 
This website was designed for my husbands improvisation theatre group named Half The Group. They have a website already but I wanted to improve it in order to reach out to more people what they offer and make it more appealing to watch them perform. 
 
I designed the website to make information about the group members and their shows easy accessible, in order to make it possible for people to follow them and companies to hire them. 
 
I wanted it to make it easy to make contact so therefor I made a contact form to enable people to reach out with questions and for companies to show their interests.
 
Here you can view their existing website: https://www.halfthegroup.com/
 
 
 
#UX
I created this website with a wish to make it responsive and to be easy to navigate on cell phones.
The colours I chose are pink, grey, white and black since I feel they work well with the existing pictures of the theatre group. I used [coolors] (https://coolors.co/806157-cccccc-cf5d9a-e5b6a9-c0287a) to find the best colour palette for the website. 
 
####Target audience:
- Family and friends
- The members of the group
- Companies interested in impro events
- People interested in joining the impro-theatre
- Supporters of the theatre group
- Audience of the theatre shows
 
As a supporter and interested in the theatre group I want to be able to see upcoming events so I can come and watch them.
 
As a supporter I want to see pictures and information about the cast in order get to know them more.
 
As a company I want information and a contact form so I can hire them on conferences and other events and make my staff happy.
 
As someone who wants to come and see a show on the theatre for the first time, I want to see the map in order to plan my trip to the theatre.
 
As someone who has questions about the theatre, wants to join the cast or has other question I want to be able to reach them easy through the contact form.
 
As a user of the this website, I want it to be easy to navigate and the pages to be visually appealing so it catches my interest so I will hire them for a company event or visit the site often.
 
 
#Wireframes
 
 
 
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
 
#Features
Navigation Bar - This allows the user to easy navigate in the site, it is consistent throughout the whole website. The user should know where they are and how to find every page easily. 
Footer Links -  To give easy access to social media pages. These are consistent on every page. 
Home page: Image Carousel - Shows three pictures on the homepage. A shout out to audience and companies! The goal is the user to buy tickets to the show and for companies to hire them. 
Ticket page: Shout out to companies again and presentation of shows and upcoming shows. 
Meet the cast page: An opportunity to get to know the cast more in a fun and easy way so the user want to see them perform. Every person is presented with a photo and a personal quote about love, since the theme is love. 
About page: The purpose is to give more information about impro, the cast, the shows and the theatre. A map is embedded to the theatre so people know where to see them perform. 
Contact Form page - Allows users to submit questions and for companies to contact the group.
 
 
#Features Left to Implement
Make a gallery with more photos and videos. 
Write more information about each team member to get to know the cast even better. 
Make one page only for companies and one page for upcoming shows. 
Make a blog about the theatre group. Upload pictures from meetings and trainings.
Offer monthly newsletters sent to email accounts. 
Information about the corona-virus situation and what Half The Group is doing to prevent the spread of the virus. 
 
 
#Technologies Used
 
HTML- I used HTML to give structure and content to the page. 
 
CSS - I used CSS to style my website.

Google Fonts - provided font-family. 
 
Balsamiq - was used to design my website. 
 
Coolors - I used this tool to get the colors i wanted to use on my page.

Code Academy- I also took a course through Code academy to understand Bootstrap and use it better on my page. 


#Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

 For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
#Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

#Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

#Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
