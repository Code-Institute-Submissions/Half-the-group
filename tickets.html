<span class="align-middle"><h3>More information about our show</h3></span> <br>


 <div class="container">
			<div class="row">


<div class="col-6"> <h6>Do you perform in Swedish or English?</h6>
<p>- The whole show will be played in English.
</p>

<h6>How much of the show do you guys actually prepare or plan in advance?</h6>
<p>- Improv is theater without a script. Everything you see on the show will be created on the spot and inspired by your suggestions. We have no idea yet what is going to happen in any show.
</p>

<h6>Where are you all from?<h6>
<p>- In total we have six nationalities.
France, Mexico, New Zealand, UK, US, Sweden.</p>

<h6>May I bring my children/baby?</h6>
<p>- We love children but "How To Fall In Love" is not a kids show. 
Kids under 10 years, they are guaranteed to have to leave in the middle and the 
actors need to be able to focus and audience as well. 
It’s the responsibility of the parent, If you think your kid(s) can handle it, sure.
</p>

<h6>When else I can see you guys?<h/6>
<p>- These 3 shows are our only 2 act shows planned at the moment. We are an independent group, and we don't know when we'll perform next in this form. Stay updated on our website! You can always book a company event with us. 
</p>

</div>
<div class="col-6"> <h6>What is improv?</h6>
    <p>- Improvisational theatre, often called improvisation or improv, is the form of theatre, often comedy, in which most or all of what is performed is unplanned or unscripted: created spontaneously by the performers. In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written script.
    </p>
    
    <h6>Do you expect audience members to participate? </h6>
<p>- We don’t need you on stage, but we need your suggestions and support. Because the more
energy we get from you the better we will be.
</p>

<h6>Romantic comedy? Weren't those full of clichés and sexism?</h6>
<p>- We do use rely on clichés and stereotypes that are recognizable, as a base for pur characters and situations. But we've worked a lot on avoiding harmful and outdated Romcom stereotypes, 
and believe there's a way to have romantic comedies in a more modern way.</p>

<h6>Is it possible to get in with a wheelchair or rullator?</h6>
<p>- Nope, Pymeteater has no other entrance or elevator. It had everything a theater built 50+ years ago.
